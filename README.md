## Hello, my name is Robert :man_technologist:

I am interested in functional programming, type theory, and category theory. After studying mathematics for ~10years I am only now learning that proofs are programs; even though this was understood in the 1970s, or even the 30s in some sense. This has driven an interested in programming language theory and proof assistants. I teach these and related ideas to second year undergraduates in Christchurch, New Zealand. I enjoy writing code in Haskell, Agda, and Lean. 

### Projects :building_construction:

I spend most of time split between refining my course materials and adding to the digital library of mathematics. However, I make other projects available on here too. 

- Digital [library](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/mathematics) of formalised mathematics :books: written in Lean.
- Lambda calculus [computer](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/lamb) :abacus: written in Haskell.
- Turing machine [interpreter](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/turing) :steam_locomotive: written in Python.
- [Course materials](https://github.com/SyntakticSugar/proofgrams) on the Curry-Howard isomorphism :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) :christmas_tree::santa:

### Vocation
I am a mathematics teacher in Christchurch, New Zealand. I am primarily involved with teaching first year undergraduates, but I do teach a second year class about logic and computation. I studied mathematics at the University of Canterbury (BSc Hons) and Australian National Univeristy (PhD) primarily studying algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, and category theory. I wrote my [thesis](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~borger/student-theses/Robert%20Culling's%20thesis.pdf) about Grothendieck's Galois Theory of schemes over the natural numbers. My interests have moved towards type theory, in particular as a language to express mathematics.
