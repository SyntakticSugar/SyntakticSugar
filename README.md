## Hello, my name is Robert :man_technologist:

I am interested in functional programming, type theory, and category theory. After studying mathematics for ~10years, I am only now learning that proofs are programs; even though this was understood in the 1970s, or even the 30s in some sense, I only became aware of this insight in 2020. For this reason, I am currently interested in learning about programming language theory and proof assistants. I teach these and related ideas to second year undergraduates in Christchurch, New Zealand. Although I have no formal training in computer science and programming, I enjoy writing code as a hobby. I enjoy coding in the Haskell, Agda, and Lean.

# Vocation
I am a mathematics teacher in Christchurch, New Zealand. I am primarily involved with teaching first year undergraduates, but I do teach a second year class about logic and computation. I studied mathematics at the University of Canterbury (BSc Hons) and Australian National Univeristy (PhD) primarily studying algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, and category theory. I wrote my [thesis](https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~borger/student-theses/Robert%20Culling's%20thesis.pdf) about Grothendieck's Galois Theory of schemes over the natural numbers. My interests have moved towards type theory and how it can be used to digitize and verify mathematical theorems.
